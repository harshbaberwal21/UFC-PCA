# UFC-PCA
Identifying structure in UFC data using PCA. Studying the UFC data can help understand the game dynamics better and to make predictions, because just like boxing, gambling on outcome is big business.


## Output
In an attempt to find structure across all the features of a UFC fight, as measured in fightmetrics data, PCA digs out a component that explains the most variance and encompasses only some type of hits landed and received. The features loaded onto this component can be seen in the below graph.
